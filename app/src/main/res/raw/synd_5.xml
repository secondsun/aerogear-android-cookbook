And it's increasingly popular: Spirit is the fastest growing airline in America. And yet lots of people really don't like Spirit Airlines. In a Consumer Reports survey published in 2013, Spirit finished last among U.S. airlines. How is the fastest growing airline also the least popular?

On today's show: we try to figure out who sent the letters, why they wanted to do business with North Korea, and what that tells us about the North Korean economy.</p>]]></itunes:subtitle>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">On September 9th, BJ Holloway's life savings were stolen. His 6 cows were taken in the dead of the night from his land in Spencer, Oklahoma. BJ looked everywhere for his stolen cattle. He asked his neighbors. He filed a police report. But out in Oklahoma, when cows are stolen, it's hard to find the thief. The cows all look alike, and the evidence disappears when they're turned into steaks. Luckily for BJ, there's a cattle cop on his case, Jerry Flowers. Flowers is a special agent in charge of the law enforcement section for the Oklahoma Department of Argiculture, and he's determined to find the outlaws who took BJ's cattle. Today on the show, Jerry Flowers chases the bad guys.</p>]]></description>

      <title>#582: Guarding The Secret Path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">In west Africa right now, there are two kinds of countries: Those that have Ebola and those that do not. Liberia for instance, has reported more than 6,000 cases of Ebola and 2,697 people have died. Right next door, in the country of Ivory Coast, there have been zero cases. Zero. Ivory Coast would desperately like to stay in that zero category.&#160;</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The solution that Ivory Coast has come up with to stay Ebola free is simple. Ivory Coast will shut down its border. It will stop trade with Liberia, stop commerce and stop people from coming in.&#160;</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">On a map, a border is a simple thing: A clear thick line. On the ground, its anything but simple. On the ground in Ivory Coast, there are vast parts of the border with no signs, no guards, and only a secret path through the forest.&#160;</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Today on the show, we go to a tiny tiny town on the border between Ivory Coast and Liberia. On one side of the line, Ebola is raging. The other side is Ebola-free so far. We ask: How do you close a border? And can you really?</p>]]></description>

      <title>#400: What Two Pasta Factories Tell Us About The Italian Economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><em>Note: Today's show is a rerun. It originally ran in&#160;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/07/160748725/episode-400-what-two-pasta-factories-tell-us-about-the-italian-economy" target="_blank">September 2012</a>.&#160;</em></p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">A decade ago, the Barilla pasta factory in Foggia, Italy, had a big problem with people skipping work.

      <title>#562: A Mall Divided</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Westfield Valley Fair Mall in California is like any other mall except for one thing: half of the mall is in the city of San Jose and the other half is in the city of Santa Clara. The boundary line runs right through the mall. For a long time, this didn't matter. But in 2012, one city &#8212; San Jose &#8212; raised its minimum wage from $8 an hour to $10 an hour. This change created two economic worlds within a single, large building. Employees doing more or less the same work, just steps away from each other, started making different wages. On today's show: minimum wage stories from a single mall. What happens when some stores suddenly have to pay their workers more &#8212; and others are still paying less.</p>]]></description>

      <title>#485: What's Your Major?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Note: Today's show is a rerun. It originally ran in September 2013. Sure, some college degrees lead to higher paying jobs than others. But what's shocking — at least, it was shocking to us — is just how big the gap can be. The most lucrative majors typically lead to jobs with salaries over $100,000 a year. The least lucrative lead to salaries of around $30,000. On today's show, we run the numbers. We talk to people who majored in the most- and least-lucrative subjects. And we hear from an economist who says, when it comes to income, choosing a major is more important than choosing a college.]]></description>

      <title>#560: Hunting For The Hundreds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The 100 dollar bill is the most popular product from the Federal Reserve. Eighty percent of all U.S. cash is in the form of 100 dollar bills, but you rarely see them. About twenty years ago, the Fed counted up all the hundreds it knew about — money in bank vaults and cash registers — and it found it had no idea where most of the hundred dollar bills had gone. And so they went on a mission to find them. Today on the show, where in the world are all the 100 dollar bills? What is Benjamin Franklin being used for? And if we don't know where they all are, should the U.S. keep making them?]]></description>

      <title>#555: Why Is The Milk In The Back Of The Store?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Milk is often in the very back corner of the grocery store, as far as humanly possible from the entrance. It's a strange location for milk, because it's one the most popular items.

But is that really why the milk is in the back? Can you really have a business model intentionally built around inconveniencing your customers? Today on the show, two big theories to answer this little question: Why is the milk in the back of the store? The theories reflect very different world views. To try to discover which is right, we host a friendly debate between food writer Michael Pollan and economist Russ Roberts.]]></description>

      <title>#538: Is A Stradivarius Just A Violin?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A trumpet is more or less a trumpet. A clarinet is a clarinet. But violin or a viola... they are different. More like living breathing things. Hand crafted from wood, from a tree. Every one is different. And, you know the story. Antonio Stradivari, was the master. Some say the greatest violin maker to ever live. The Stradivarius is one of the most powerful and expensive brands in the world. And certainly, the guy made really nice instruments. But how nice exactly. This is a question that comes up all the time with all kinds of products: coffee, clothes, dish washing detergent, jeans and shoes. How much of a brand is real? And how much is in our heads? Of course you could do a test with a stradivarius to answer this exact question. And In fact, in 2010, researchers did just that.  ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Note: Today's show is a re-run. It originally ran in March, 2013. Sometimes your success depends on how your competitors behave. People judge you not just by your product, but by the product that your rival down the street makes. This is a problem for Lou Caracciolo. He's trying to make high-quality wine, from grapes he grows in New Jersey. But Jersey wine already has a reputation — and fancy isn't it. On today's show: Can New Jersey become the next Napa? For more, see Adam Davidson's latest NYT Magazine column, Bottle Bing.  ]]></description>

There is a different set of standards in Europe.

The new Volkswagen Golf R is driving on the autobahns in Berlin, but not yet in the US.

      <description><![CDATA[A 30-year old woman finds out she has a viral infection attacking her heart that will kill her unless she has a transplant. Four years later she gets a new heart and goes on to summit Mt. Kilimanjaro. Inspiring story right? Will it move you to become an organ donor? Not necessarily. And that's a problem for the 120 thousand people waiting for organs in the United States. Behavior change is hard. That's something that organ donor advocates know firsthand. Polls indicate most Americans support organ donations, but less than half are actually registered as donors. So how do you get people to make the leap from thought to action? In today's show, the story of one woman who believes she is close to an answer by partnering with one of the more hated American institutions.]]></description>

These are ordinary people — not Amazon employees — who write and record hundreds of astonishingly detailed reviews on Amazon. At this moment, Amazon's number 1 reviewer is Michael Erb (Amazon screen name, M. Erb). He's has reviewed more than 850 products, ranging from telescopes to facial wipes. On today's show, we talk to Erb and another top reviewer, and we try to figure out: Why do they spend so much time and effort reviewing stuff on Amazon?]]></itunes:subtitle>

      <title>#391: The Anti-Addiction Pill That's Big Business For Drug Dealers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There's a pill called Suboxone that treats addiction to heroin and pain pills like oxycontin. Doctors and addicts say it's amazing. "It was the best thing that ever happened," one heroin addict told us. "I was like OH. MY. LORD. This is a miracle pill." The government spent tens of millions of dollars developing Suboxone. Doctors can prescribe it in their offices. But a lot of people who want it can't get it from a doctor, so they have to buy it on the street. Today on the show: Why people have to turn to drug dealers to get a pill that fights addiction. Note: This episode was originally posted last year. For more, see this paper on the history of Suboxone. Download the Planet Money iPhone App. Music: POP ETC's "Keep It For Your Own" and Snoop Dogg's "Whistle While You Hustle."

      <description><![CDATA[So we're making a T-shirt and we do this Kickstarter campaign and we raise $590,807 (which, really, we can't thank you enough). It turns out the money collected on Kickstarter is handled by Amazon. Great, we figure: This is the company that will sell you anything on the planet and get it you you the next day. And what we need in this case isn't even a thing, really. We just need Amazon's bank to send money electronically to a checking account at Chase bank. It's just information traveling over wires. How long could it take: A minute? An hour? It took five days. On today's show: Why the invisible pipes that move money around America are so slow. (And why the ones in England are so much faster.)

      <title>#352: The High-Tech Cow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we visit Fulper Farms, a family-run dairy in New Jersey. It's a bucolic setting — white farmhouse, rolling hills, etc. But behind that peaceful image lies all the roiling tension, rising inequality and economic volatility of the 21st-century economy. We meet Claudia, the prized, high-tech cow. And we learn why even a barn full of Claudias wouldn't be enough to keep a family-run dairy afloat. For More: Meet Claudia, The High-Tech Cow Note: This episode was originally posted last year. Music: Eddie Albert's "Green Acres" and The Kinks' "Animal Farm."

      <title>#488: The Secret History Of Your Cable Bill</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you have cable, your bill has probably doubled over the past decade. The rise is largely driven by fees for channels you have to pay for, whether you want them or not. ESPN alone is costing you more than $5 a month — even if you never watch it. On today's show, we answer the question every cable subscriber has asked: Why can't I just pay for the channels I want?

      <title>#482: Why The U.S. Keeps Sending Weapons To Egypt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As the Egyptian military cracked down on protesters last week, U.S.-made Apache helicopters flew overhead. The Egyptian military also uses American made tanks, fighter jets and bullets. This is the product of the $1.3 billion in military aid the U.S. provides to Egypt every year. In polls, a majority of Egyptians say they want that aid to end. And it's become unpopular among some powerful Americans as well. Yet, so far, the aid hasn't stopped flowing.

      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we meet a woman who is trying to bring nuance and subtlety to a world of black-and-white rules: pregnancy. Emily Oster is an economist and the author of a book called Expecting Better. Like our own Chana Joffe-Walt — who takes a break from maternity leave to host today's show — Oster found herself confused and frustrated by all the rules of pregnancy. Unlike Chana, Emily Oster decided to read almost every study that had every been conducted on pregnancy and risk. Today, we talk to Oster about what she discovered.

      <description><![CDATA[More than half of all Japanese women quit their jobs after giving birth to their first child. That's more than double the rate in the U.S., and it's a problem for Japan's economy. If more women returned to the workforce, it would go a huge way toward boosting growth in the country and solving a big demographic problem — not enough working people to support the nation's retirees. But finding childcare in Japan is even harder than finding childcare in the U.S. The long-term solution is robot nannies. (Really.)

      <title>Episode 386: The Cost Of Free Doughnuts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody likes free. But free can be dangerous, too. Today's show is sort of the flip side free.

And the damage can be enormous.</p><p>This week, free of charge, Chana Joffe-Walt and Alex Blumberg tell the story of the Red Cross and free doughnuts &#8212; that suddenly weren't free any more. It happened 70 years ago, and the Red Cross is still feeling the consequences.</p><p>***Note this episode originally aired in July 2012.***</p>]]></description>

      <title>#470: Killing Fannie Mae</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Five years after the financial crisis, the federal government still controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two giant companies that guarantee trillions of dollars in mortgages. This is a huge, little-discussed part of the post-crisis economy. Almost everybody agrees that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook when their neighbors don't pay their mortgages. But the government doesn't have a clear plan to get out of the mortgage business. Last week, two senators (a Republican and a Democrat) introduced a bill that would get rid of Fannie and Freddie and reduce the government's role in the mortgage business. On today's show, we try to figure out what the new bill means. And we revisit the story of the rise of Fannie and Freddie, which we first talked about on the show a few years back.]]></description>

      <title>#468: Kid Rock Vs. The Scalpers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We live in a society full of people who are obsessed with making sure that prices are right and supply meets demand. And then there's the live-music business. Concert tickets are often too cheap, and the supply is too limited. Scalpers are the proof: If tickets were more expensive to begin with, or if venues were bigger, scalpers wouldn't be able to charge more than face value. On today's show, we talk to Kid Rock about how he's trying to cut scalpers out of the business — and still sell cheap tickets to his shows. For More: See Adam Davidson's New York Times Magazine column, How Much Is Michael Bolton Worth to You? Read Josh Baron and Dean Budnick's book: Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped and economist Pascal Courty's many papers on the topic.]]></description>

      <title>#463: How To Get A Country To Trust Its Banks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's something you can see on every block in most major cities. You probably see it every day and never give a second thought to. But in Yangon, Myanmar, an ATM is a small miracle. For decades, Myanmar was cut off from the rest of the world. There were international sanctions, and no one in the U.S. or Europe did business there. But last year, when the international sanctions started to be lifted, companies like Visa and Mastercard were excited to come in. The country has about 50 million people — that's a lot of potential customers to pay ATM fees. Setting up these machines has been a technological challenge because of the country's aging infrastructure. But there is a bigger problem with ATMs here that a lot of the international companies weren't expecting. The people in Myanmar are reluctant to use ATMs because they don't trust the banks. "The banks don't work very well," says Zeya Thu, a journalist. " Sometimes you have to bribe the staff to get your money back. So people put their money under their mattresses." Thu is a business columnist, but even he keeps his life savings at home, out of the bank. On today's show, how do you get a country to join the world economy when the people there don't even trust their own banks.]]></description>

      <title>#462: When Patents Hit the Podcast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in the nineties, Jim Logan started a company called Personal Audio. The concept was simple — people could pick out magazine articles they liked on the internet, and his company would send them a cassette tape of those articles being read out loud. The cassette tapes didn't catch on like Jim hoped, but he had bigger dreams for the idea behind them. He dreamed that one day you wouldn't need a cassette player, you would just be able to hear smart people talking about whatever subject you wanted, and that audio would be magically downloaded to a device of your choice. He says he dreamed of podcasting as we know it today. Now Jim Logan did not create the technology to podcast. He himself is not a modern-day podcaster. But he did get a patent on that big dream of downloading personalized audio, and he claims to have the patent on podcasting. On today's show, he says all the people out there podcasting today, owe him money. For more, check out Alex Blumberg and Laura Sydell's story on this weekend's This American Life :When Patents Attack...Part Two!]]></description>

      <title>#460: It's Hard To Do Good</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 2010, we reported on a poor town in Haiti, where school was held in a small, one-room church. Planet Money listeners were moved to donate some $3,000, which the principal of the school thought would be enough to build a school. A few months later, the money was gone, and all there was to show for it was a foundation, some concrete blocks and some rock and sand. We thought that would be the end of it. Then we heard from Tim Myers, a retired contractor from Colorado who decided to go to Haiti to build the school — and who realized, in 2011, that the project would cost more than $100,000. On today's show: We return to Haiti, to see how the project is going. And we hear from Tim Myers, who says, if he had it to do over, he might do things differently.]]></description>

      <title>#458: Bangladesh's T-Shirt Economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[H&M, Zara, Wal-Mart and JC Penney all buy t-shirts from Bangladesh. Soon, Planet Money will too. As you may have heard, we're making a t-shirt and telling the story of how it's made. We decided a few months ago to work with Jockey to make our t-shirts. Our women's shirt will be made in Colombia. Our men's shirt will be made, in part, in Bangladesh. But horrifying news has been coming out of Bangladesh's apparel industry recently. A garment factory collapsed a few weeks ago, killing more than 1,000 people. Last year, a factory fire killed hundreds of workers. As part of the t-shirt project, we'll be traveling to Bangladesh to report on the industry. On today's show, we start to ask: Is buying a t-shirt from Bangladesh a good thing or a bad thing for the people of Bangladesh? For more: See Adam Davidson's latest New York Times Magazine column, Economic Recovery, Made in Bangladesh?]]></description>

      <title>#224: The Cotton Wars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we meet a Brazilian who took on the world's largest superpower; a Texas cotton farmer who's tired of hearing the Brazilians complain; and a guy named Renato — a.k.a. Retaliation Master. And we hear why U.S. taxpayers are paying Brazilian cotton growers nearly $150 million a year. This show originally ran in 2011, near the beginning of our quest to make a Planet Money t-shirt. We're re-playing it now because we just re-launched the t-shirt project. If you want a Planet Money t-shirt, visit our Kickstarter page. We had more about the project in our most recent podcast, The Planet Money T-Shirt Is Finally (Almost) Here. Music: Johnny Cash's "Cotton Fields" Find us: Twitter/ Facebook/Spotify/ Tumblr. Download the Planet Money iPhone App.]]></description>

      <title>#357: How Much Should We Trust Economics?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Three years ago, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff published a study that quickly became one of the most famous, most talked about economics papers since the financial crisis. It got so much attention because it answered a basic question everybody was asking: How much debt is too much? Reinhart and Rogoff looked at what had happened in many different countries over many years. And they found a what looked like a clear debt threshold: 90 percent. Average growth was much, much slower in countries with debt-to-gdp ratios over 90 percent. The paper got a lot of coverage in the press. Politicians cited it in the U.S. and Europe. Then, this week, a 28-year-old grad student and his professors published a startling finding: Reinhart and Rogoff had made a simple Excel error in one part of their study. The authors of the new critique also questioned other elements of the study and argued that, in fact, there is no debt threshold. On today's show, we hear from the grad student who found the error. And we ask: How much should we trust economics?]]></description>

      <title>#356: The Surprisingly Entertaining History of The Income Tax</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a really conflicted history with the income tax. For most of American history, there was no income tax at all. At one point it was ruled unconstitutional. Today, income tax is the federal government's main source of revenue. That raises a question: How did something that was once so strange to us become so central? The answer includes a few wars, a Supreme Court justice on his deathbed, and Donald Duck. For More: Read our post, "From Abe Lincoln To Donald Duck: History Of The Income Tax."And see War and Taxes, the book Joe Thorndike co-wrote. Subscribe to the podcast.

The answer includes a few wars, a Supreme Court justice on his deathbed, and Donald Duck. For More: Read our post, "From Abe Lincoln To Donald Duck: History Of The Income Tax."And see War and Taxes, the book Joe Thorndike co-wrote. Subscribe to the podcast. Music: Nero's "The Promise" and Danny Kaye's "I Paid My Income Tax Today." Find us: Twitter/ Facebook/ Spotify/ Tumblr. Note: This podcast was originally published last year.]]></itunes:subtitle>

      <description><![CDATA[Since the start of the year, the Japanese yen has risen by about 12 percent against the dollar. The euro has fallen by about 1 percent. Then there's bitcoin, a virtual currency that doesn't even exist in the physical world. In the past few months, the value of bitcoin has risen by more than 1,000 percent — from less than $20 per bitcoin a few months ago to more than $200 today. On today's show, we ask: Is a skyrocketing value a good thing or a bad thing for bitcoin?]]></description>

      <title>#448: Coney Island Back In Business</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Hurricane Sandy struck, it devastated businesses all over New York City. One area hit particularly hard was Coney Island, an iconic New York beach at the tip of South Brooklyn. At the time, we reported on the damage to a family-owned amusement park, Deno's Wonderwheel Amusement Park, home to the Wonder Wheel, bumper cars, and the Spook-A-Rama. We reported that the place was basically doomed. But it turns out, our report was a kind of premature obituary for the business. We return to the amusement park, about 5 months after the storm, and find things shockingly normal. Businesses like Deno's are back and some of them are thriving. On today's show, an economic case study. What brought Coney Island back so quickly?]]></description>

      <title>#290: North Korea's Illegal Economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Note: This podcast was originally published in 2011. With North Korea in the news again this week, we're re-running it today. North Korea relies on charity to feed its starving people. But the country's elites like their luxuries — imported wine, fine china, dancing shoes. To buy those things, they need foreign currency. (North Korean currency is worthless outside of North Korea.) To get foreign currency, they need to sell things to the outside world. But North Korea's industrial base is a disaster, and the country doesn't grow enough food to feed itself. On today's Planet Money, we look at the ways North Korea's leaders have managed to keep foreign currency flowing into the country. Their strategies include manufacturing drugs, counterfeiting U.S. dollars, and selling gigantic statues to foreign leaders. For more at www.npr.org/money.]]></description>

      <title>#446 The Invisible 14 Million</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We're an economics show. We cover the economy. But it's come to our attention that, until now, we've missed one of the biggest stories in our economy: The startling rise in the number of people on federal disability programs. It's the story of 14 million people who don't show up in most of the numbers we look at to understand the economy. These 14 million Americans don't have jobs, but they don't show up in any of the unemployment measures that we use. They receive federal assistance, but are often overlooked in discussions of the social safety net. On today's show: What disability in America says about the state of the American workforce, and about what it means to be poor in America nearly 20 years after we ended welfare as we knew it. For much, much more on disability, see our giant online story and listen to This American Life this weekend (we're doing the whole hour on disability). And we'll have more disability stories next week on All Things Considered. Correction: An earlier version of this episode incorrectly named the Minnesota congressman who at first voted against the legislation that expanded the definition of disability. His name is Tim Penny and not Tim Perry.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Despite all the celebration, the Dow Jones industrial average has not hit record highs recently. If you adjust for inflation, the highs just aren't as high as they seem. And even if we do hit a real, inflation-adjusted high in the next few weeks, it won't mean much. The Dow is a seriously flawed stock index, and it's certainly not a good way to measure what's going on in the overall economy. On today's show, we rain on the Dow's parade and explain why a lot of very smart people, hate this index so much.

There are thousands of Amish run firms out there making everything from plumbing supplies to furniture. But running an Amish business poses unique challenges. Many Amish don't connect to the electrical grid. They don't drive cars. They prize modesty, meaning traditional advertising slogans like "best," "fastest," and "greatest" are out. An Amish company has to be creative about these things. And, the Amish have tricks they can teach the rest of the business world. For one, they have perfected the art of marketing to a niche audience.

      <title>#435: Why Buying A Car Is So Awful</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In survey after survey, people rank buying a car as one of their least favorite experiences. Why hasn't anyone figured out a better way to sell cars? Why can't you just go to a car store and shop for cars from a bunch of different manufacturers? Why don't cars have real price tags — with real prices, that people actually pay? Today on the show: Why car buying is so unpleasant, and what your local legislators may be doing to keep it that way.]]></description>

      <title>#434: Dealing with Danger, Death, And Crime</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's show: Four short stories about how we deal with danger, death, and crime. Here's more on those stories: 1. Why Is The Government In The Flood Insurance Business? The quick answer to why the government sells flood insurance: a hugely damaging hurricane named Betsy. 2. Should Gun Owners Have To Buy Liability Insurance? Most states require car owners to have liability insurance to cover damages their vehicles cause to others; some economists think we should require the same for gun owners. 3. Lance Armstrong's Confession Could Cost Him Millions How one interview could mean he'll have to pay back all the money the U.S. Postal Service and others paid to sponsor his cycling career. 4. How Happy Is America? The government is considering adopting a national happiness index. But how do you measure happiness?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ecuador's Yasuni National Park is an amazing rainforest — home to jaguars, giant otters, the golden-mantled tamarin and woolly monkeys. The park also sits on top of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, worth billions of dollars. The government of Ecuador faces a choice: Should it protect the park, or go for the money? The country is trying to do both. The government says it will promise to leave its rainforest untouched — if rich counties give Ecuador billions of dollars.]]></description>

      <title>#331: How Office Politics Could Take Down Europe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Note: This is an updated version of a podcast that originally aired in Dec., 2011. If you're looking for the beginning — and, possibly, the end — of the European financial crisis, you can find it in a single building: The Greek statistics office, at 46 Peireos Street in Athens. We visited recently and found what may be the world's most high-stakes game of office politics. On one side: The technocrats, led by Andreas Georgiou, who was appointed last year to run the office. On the other : The old guard, including Konstantinos Skordas. Georgiou's technocratic ways — like reporting Greek deficit figures directly to European authorities — have landed him in hot water with the old guard. His email was hacked, he says. His workers went out on strike. And now he is facing criminal charges that could lead to life in prison.]]></description>

Colbert described it on his Threatdown segment: The global food shortage is finally becoming an important story, because now it is affecting me. Costco and Sam's Club are now both rationing rice. You can't buy more than 80 pounds in a single visit. How am I supposed to make my famous kiddie pool paella?!? The most mysterious thing about this shortage of rice: There was more than enough to go around. It is the epic story of a shortage that wasn't. In this global caper of good intentions gone wrong, there are shadowy trade deals, corrupt government officials, and warehouses full of rice in a country that didn't want it.

      <description><![CDATA[On today's show: Three short stories about the stuff we buy — books, toys and clothes. 1. Are E-Books Actually Destroying Traditional Publishing? Conventional wisdom says e-books are destroying the traditional publishing business model. People pay less for e-books and that drives down price. When you talk to publishers though, you realize the story's not that simple. 2. Why Legos Are So Expensive — And So Popular Legos often cost twice as much as similar blocks from a rival toymaker. So why are Legos so much more popular than other brands? 3. 3-D Printing Is (Kind Of) A Big Deal It's miraculous to see: Press a button, make anything you want. But will it transform the economy?]]></description>

Local officials are trying to turn Williston into a real town, where people want to bring their families. But it's a tough sell. On today's show, we visit Williston, and we learn why one guy endures a thousand-mile commute, why a one-bedroom apartment costs $2100 a month, and why the town is building an indoor lazy river.]]></description>

From 1886 until the late 1950s, a bottle of Coke cost a nickel. On today's show, we find out why.

      <title>#415: Can A Poor Country Start Over?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Today's show is the story of two men and one big idea. The big idea is that a poor country should take a small, empty part of its territory and say: We're going to build a new city here. And in this new city, we're going to get rid of our existing laws and rules, and bring in the best laws we can find from around the world. Get help from foreign countries. Maybe the UK could serve as a court of appeals. Maybe Canada could send in a few Mounties to help set up a police force. The two men are Paul Romer, a world famous North American economist, and Octavio Sanchez, chief of staff to the president of Honduras. They think their big idea could be the answer to one of the oldest, hardest problems in economics: How do poor countries get richer? And they seem like a perfect match. Paul is a famous economist who can sell the idea around the world. Octavio has the ear of the president in a poor country looking for a change. On the show, we find out what happens when they try to make their idea a reality.]]></description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today's show is the story of two men and one big idea. The big idea is that a poor country should take a small, empty part of its territory and say: We're going to build a new city here. And in this new city, we're going to get rid of our existing laws and rules, and bring in the best laws we can find from around the world. Get help from foreign countries. Maybe the UK could serve as a court of appeals. Maybe Canada could send in a few Mounties to help set up a police force. The two men are Paul Romer, a world famous North American economist, and Octavio Sanchez, chief of staff to the president of Honduras. They think their big idea could be the answer to one of the oldest, hardest problems in economics: How do poor countries get richer? And they seem like a perfect match. Paul is a famous economist who can sell the idea around the world. Octavio has the ear of the president in a poor country looking for a change. On the show, we find out what happens when they try to make their idea a reality.]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>#335: Who Killed Lard?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[You rarely see lard on menus. There aren't shelves and shelves of it in every supermarket. In this country, we've sort of lost touch with the once beloved pig fat. On today's podcast, we ask — who killed lard? Was it Upton Sinclair? His novel, The Jungle, contained this memorable passage about the men who cook the lard: ...and as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting,— sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham's Pure Leaf Lard! Or should we blame William Procter and James Gamble? It was their company which created a new alternative to lard — the "pure and wholesome" Crisco. Note: Today's podcast is a rerun. It first ran in January, 2012.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For months now, we've been creating a fake presidential candidate based on the best ideas economics has to offer. We came up with a platform, with the help of a panel of economists. We hashed out the disagreement among the panel. We brought in political consultants who laughed at us, but also gave us some great messaging ideas. Today, we take it to the people — or, at least, a focus group. We find out whether these economically sound ideas can get anyone's vote. And we create a couple real ads for our fake candidate.]]></description>

      <title>#412: How To Fix The Patent Mess</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Two big patent cases this summer in the smartphone industry: 1. A jury finds that Samsung violated Apple's patents, and orders Samsung to pay Apple $1 billion. 2. A judge throws out a case between Apple and Motorola (now owned by Google). The judge goes on to write an article in the Atlantic arguing that there are too many patents in America, and lots of industries could probably get along fine with no patents at all. These radically different rulings were just the latest reminder that the world of software patents is a mess. Big companies that should be focused on inventing the next great thing are instead spending billions of dollars buying up patents and suing each other. Small companies have to worry that someone with some random patent is going to sue them and shut them down. On today's show, we talk with Mark Lemley, who has some ideas for fixing the patent mess. Lemley is a professor at Stanford law school and an expert on software patents. Lemley also works for clients in the private sector, including Google.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Note: This show is a re-run. It originally aired in April, 2011. Lots of economists write about the economics of illegal drugs. Here's a paper from a Harvard guy. Here's another co-authored by a couple Chicago guys. One thing missing from those papers: Actual drug dealers. So for today's podcast, we run some economic theory by Freeway Rick Ross (pictured), who was one of the biggest crack dealers in LA in the '80s and '90s. He went to prison in '96, and was released on parole in '09. Economists say that people demand a "risk premium" to do illegal, risky work. But it didn't feel that way to Ross: When you come from where I was when I started selling drugs, you feel hopeless. You don't think you're going to live past 24 years old. Go to jail, come out with stripes. Really wasn't any risk. Everything I had going on at the time, it was nothing. I was like a lump on a log. The risk most people would look at — you could get killed, go to prison — was Ok. What's more, he really liked being a drug kingpin. I loved it. ... I felt like I was powerful. ... It was every man's dream to be free. ... I'd rather be doing that than anything else, almost.]]></description>

      <title>#400: What Two Pasta Factories Tell Us About The Italian Economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A decade ago, the Barilla pasta factory in Foggia, Italy, had a big problem with people skipping work. The absentee rate was around 10 percent. People called in sick all the time, typically on Mondays, or on days when there was a big soccer game. Foggia is in southern Italy. Barilla's big factory in northern Italy had a much lower absentee rate. This is not surprising; there's a huge economic gap between southern and northern Italy. It's like two different countries. Barilla execs told Nicola Calandrea, the manager of the Foggia plant, that they would close the factory unless he brought the absenteeism rate down. Calandrea decided that to save the factory, he had to change the culture. On today's show, we visit the factory and hear how Calandrea made it work.]]></description>

      <title>#279: The Failure Tour Of Manhattan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we hit the streets of Manhattan with economist Tim Harford. In his book, Adapt, Harford argues that success always starts with failure. Harford takes us on a failure tour of New York. Highlights include a Gutenberg Bible (turns out the Bible business wasn't so good to Gutenberg) and the Woolworth Building (Woolworth's had some great innovations in its day, but eventually got beat by big-box stores). Failure, Harford argues, is essential to economic growth. Old companies fail and are replaced by newer companies with fresh ideas. Perhaps inevitably, we wind up on Wall Street. "Of course we have this classic phrase now, 'too big to fail,'" Harford says. "That really tells you what was wrong with Wall Street: We created institutions that couldn't fail safely."]]></description>

He thinks he recently discovered a new steak — a novel way to cut up a chunk of beef that's currently not worth much. Mata is so excited about his discovery that he's trying to patent it. This raises a basic question: Can you patent a steak? On today's show, we talk to Mata. We visit the workshop of Gene Gagliardi, the inventor of Steak-Umm and KFC's popcorn chicken. And we try to figure out what meat inventors tell us about patents and innovation.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we talk to Nicholas Wapshott, author of Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics. That clash is still clashing today. Paul Ryan has cited Hayek as an influence (though they disagree on some key points); President Obama has clearly been influenced by Keynes. And, really, there's no way to reconcile the ideas. "This election is about two profound, competing theories that really can't exist in the same room at the same time," Wapshott says. It's on.]]></description>

      <title>#397: Why The Hero Of Harrisburg Couldn't Save The City</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The city of Harrisburg, Pa owes over $1.5 billion. David Unkovic, the city's former receiver, tried to save the broke city, but his plan just led to political trouble. A few months ago, Unkovic left a scrawled, handwritten note on the steps of the courthouse. "I find myself in an untenable position in the political and ethical crosswinds," the letter said, "and am no longer in a position to effectuate a solution." Unkovic fled Harrisburg and stopped answering emails, phone calls, and questions from the press. Until recently. He's started to speak out about what drove Harrisburg into debt — and what drove him out of town. On the show today, Unkovic speaks. And eats a Philly pretzel.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In spite of the drought, many U.S. farmers will do just fine this year. They are, after all, covered by crop insurance — a program that costs U.S. taxpayers $7 billion a year. On today's show, we travel to Fairbury, Illinois. We meet three generations of farmers who tell us that, even without government-subsidized crop insurance, their farms would survive the drought. So why does the government spend so much on crop insurance programs? We talk to an ag economist who has a surprising answer.]]></description>

      <title>#389: Handling Other People's Money</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For today's show, we've collected three Planet Money radio stories never before heard on the show. All of them deal with people who handle other people's money — a politician's, a workforce's, and even a continent's: Just How Blind Are Blind Trusts, Anyway?: With questions swirling about Mitt Romney's investments, a look at how blind trusts really work. The European Central Bank's Guide To Influence: With much of the continent on shaky financial grounds, the ECB is all about influencing governments, not making friends. Public Pensions Are About To Look Less Healthy: Accounting rules are changing, and that could mean a nasty surprise for a lot of public employees. (And for more on just what's behind the change, see Monday's blog post, Why Public Pensions Are About To Look Less Healthy.)]]></description>

      <title>#388: Putting A Price-Tag On Your Descendants</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Given a choice between $50 now and $100 in a month, many people would take the money now. But offered $50 in a year, or $100 in 13 months, they'd wait the extra month to double their money. The lesson: People have a "present bias," says Frank Partnoy, a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego. "So people have more impatience in a one-month time period than they do in a one-year time period." This turns out to have immense implications for public policy — implications that add up to many trillions of dollars over time, and mean the difference between valuing the lives of future generations at a few pennies, or hundreds of billions of dollars. Consider: If it would cost several trillion dollars to save Los Angeles from being wiped off the map by massive floods that are likely to occur only once every few hundred years, is it worth it? The answer hinges on the discount rate — the rate you use to size up future costs.]]></description>

And in the process, they gave us an economic platform that would surely sink any candidate that supported it. On today's show: The Planet Money economic platform.

      <title>#384: The Little Lie That Rocked The Banks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There's a certain amount of trust underpinning the financial markets. But recent news out of the United Kingdom has shaken the world's faith in a key element of the system. That element is the number banks use to determine how much to charge their customers — think of it as the measuring stick that determines nearly every other other interest rate around: mortgages, credit cards, corporate loans, complex derivatives transactions. It's called LIBOR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, and it pretty much underpins everything. For years, the British Bankers' Association has calculated the rate by asking big banks what they are paying to borrow from other banks. The answers were largely taken on faith. Now it turns out that at least one big bank — Barclays — was skewing the numbers, during the financial crisis and before. Emails cited in a regulatory complaint against the bank show the casual way the efforts were discussed. Other banks are under investigation as well. The result: Criminal and parliamentary inquiries on two continents, lawsuits, and a lot of mistrust and uncertainty about interest rates across the financial markets. On today's show, we look at how Barclays bankers sought to manipulate Libor, and why the repercussions will be felt throughout the global financial system for years to come.]]></description>

It's called LIBOR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, and it pretty much underpins everything. For years, the British Bankers' Association has calculated the rate by asking big banks what they are paying to borrow from other banks. The answers were largely taken on faith. Now it turns out that at least one big bank — Barclays — was skewing the numbers, during the financial crisis and before. Emails cited in a regulatory complaint against the bank show the casual way the efforts were discussed. Other banks are under investigation as well. The result: Criminal and parliamentary inquiries on two continents, lawsuits, and a lot of mistrust and uncertainty about interest rates across the financial markets.

This is a problem for Europe right now, as depositors continue to pull money out of banks in Spain and Greece.
